## Tennessee Eastman process üè≠

In this notebook we will illustrate the capabilities of some unsupervised learning techniques that perform dimensionality reduction applied to the task of process monitoring. The case-study that we are going to use is the called Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) [{cite}`downs1993plant`]. The data collected here corresponds to simulated data and it is widely used in the process monitoring community. Initially, TEP was created by the company [Eastman](https://www.eastman.com/en) to provide a realistic scenerario in which to test different process monitoring methods.

In the following we will provide a short explanation of the process. If you like to have a more detailed explanation overall read Chapter 8 of [{cite}`russell2000data`].

The process consist of five major units:

*   Reactor
*   Condenser
*   Compressor
*   Separator
*   Stripper

and it contains eight components: the gaseous reactants $A$, $C$, $D$ and $E$ that are fed into the reactor along the inert $B$ to produce the liquids $G$ and $H$. The product $F$ is an unwanted byproduct.

$$
A(g) + C(g) + D(g) ‚Üí G(liq)
$$

$$
A(g) + C(g) + E(g) ‚Üí H(liq)
$$

$$
A(g) + E(g) ‚Üí F(liq)
$$

$$
3D(g) ‚Üí 2F(liq)
$$

The reactor product stream is then cooled using the condenser and fed to a flash separator. A recycle is implemented via the compressor with the necessary purge to prevent accumulation of $B$ and $F$. Finally, the liquid outlet of the separator is fed into a stripper for further separation. See the figure below for a schematic reresentation of the flowsheet.

The dataset contains 41 measured states and 11 manipulated variables. Some variables are sampled every 3 minutes, 6 minutes or 15 minutes. And all measurements include Gaussian noise.

The data contains 21 faults, out of which 16 are known (Faults 1-15 and 21). Some faults are caused by step changes in some process variables, while others are associated with a random variability increase. A slow drift in the reaction kinetics and sticking valves are other causes of the faults.
